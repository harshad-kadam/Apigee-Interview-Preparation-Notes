# :label::bookmark: Apigee-Interview-Preparation-Notes DAY 4 :high_brightness:
---
---
|1. How many policies in one proxy:|
|:------------|
- varying based on proxy average min 10 to max 45-50, some proxies are having 70+, that was actually wrong aproach of devlopment apigee is an gateway which shouldn't have heavy lifting logics/implementations. this was existing implementation 
- many collaborative discussions happend to decide standards, whatever new proxies we are developing we are trying to avoid/reduce burden of heavy lifting at apigee side. 

---
---
|2. flow callout vs flow hooks|
|:------------|
> Both Flow Callouts and Flow Hooks are powerful mechanisms in Apigee Edge for extending and customizing the behavior of your APIs. However, they serve distinct purposes and operate in different contexts:

> 1. Flow Callout:
```
Description: A policy within a shared flow that allows invoking another shared flow at specific points in the API proxy execution flow.
Purpose: Used to inject reusable functionality from a shared flow into various stages of an API proxy's processing.
Benefits:
-Promotes code reuse and modularity by sharing common logic across multiple API proxies.
-Enables consistent application of policies or transformations at different points in the flow.
-Provides flexibility in controlling when and where to execute specific logic within the API proxy.
Example: permission validations and standard mediation logics like trimming etc, this kina of common logics can be implemented using Flow Callout.
```
> 2. Flow Hook:
```
Description: A configuration option at the environment, proxy, or target level that allows attaching a specific shared flow to be executed at a pre-defined point in the processing flow.
Purpose: Enables applying consistent enforcement of policies or transformations across all API proxies or targets within a defined scope.
Benefits:
-Enforces policies or logic across a group of resources (environments, proxies, or targets) without modifying individual API proxies.
-Simplifies management by centralizing shared logic in a single location.
-Ideal for enforcing broad security requirements or common transformations across your API ecosystem.
Example: You can attach a flow hook to the pre-proxy flow in your environment to enforce authentication for all API proxies deployed in that environment.
```

|3. can you add error handling logics into post proxy flow hook?|
|:------------|
> shared flow never contains faultrule,
> In the case of larger integration with multiple systems having different formats REST & SOAP we need to handle it at main proxy level.
> because organizations are trying to integrate with multiple partners. they don't know in the upcoming with whom they need to integrate their business and what error standards new partners will be following
> so it's better to keep this at main proxy level.
---
---
|4. Explain Developer portal and how to onboard APIâ€™s into the portal?|
|:------------|
> The Apigee Developer Portal acts as a central hub for developers to discover, explore, and utilize APIs offered by your organization. It streamlines the onboarding process by providing a user-friendly interface and simplifies API management for both developers and API providers.

> Here's a breakdown of how the Apigee Developer Portal works:
```
-Develop & Secure API: Build secure API in Apigee Edge.
-Create API Product: Bundle secure API and policies.
-Connect Drupal Portal: Link portal to Apigee Edge.
-Configure Drupal Portal: Set connection and sync details.
-Developer Registration: Create accounts in Drupal portal.
-App Creation & Keys: Developers create apps and get API keys.
-Consume the API: Use keys to access API functionalities.
```

|12. key factors of API design|
|:------------|
- Resource Orientation: Use nouns, not verbs, for endpoints.
- HTTP Methods: Map actions to correct HTTP methods.
- Parameters: Use query/path parameters for filtering/sorting.
- HTTP Status Codes: Return correct codes (200, 400, etc).
- Versioning: Strategically version your API for evolution.
- Pagination: Manage large datasets with pagination.
- Data Formats: Support standard formats (JSON, XML).
- Error Handling: Provide clear and informative error messages.
- OpenAPI (Swagger): Define API using OpenAPI specifications.
---
---
|13. Explain Two-Way SSL?|
|:------------|
```
Two-Way SSL: A Secure Handshake
Two-way SSL, also known as mutual authentication, goes beyond the traditional SSL/TLS setup by offering an additional layer of security. Here's how it works:

1. Mutual Verification:
-Both the client (e.g., your web browser) and the server (e.g., the website you're visiting) exchange certificates containing their public keys.
-Each party then uses their private key to digitally sign the received certificate, verifying the other's authenticity.

2. Enhanced Security:
-Compared to one-way SSL, where only the server authenticates itself, two-way SSL provides an additional layer of trust by confirming the client's identity as well.
-This helps prevent unauthorized access attempts and ensures you're communicating with the intended server, mitigating risks like man-in-the-middle attacks.

3. Trusted Communication:
-By establishing mutual trust, two-way SSL creates a secure communication channel where both parties can be confident about who they're interacting with.
-This is especially valuable in scenarios where sensitive data exchange is involved, such as online banking or financial transactions.

In essence, two-way SSL offers a more secure and reliable communication environment by ensuring both parties involved are legitimate and authorized to communicate.
```

|14. Apigee architecture|
|:------------|
```
breakdown of the Apigee architecture and components, aiming for greater clarity and a focus on the key functionalities:

1] Core Components:
-Message Router: The initial entry point for API traffic. It routes requests to the correct Message Processor, handling load balancing for efficiency.
-Message Processor: The heart of API processing. It executes Apigee policies, mediates backend calls, formats responses, and enforces security and management rules.
-Cassandra Database: A scalable NoSQL database that stores essential runtime data such as API configurations, OAuth tokens, and application keys.
-ZooKeeper: Coordinates distributed configuration information across Apigee components, ensuring consistency and notifying about updates.

2] Management and Development Tools:
-Management Server: Handles administrative API requests, provides a central management interface, and interacts with the UI.
-Apigee UI: A user-friendly web-based interface for building API proxies, managing API products, and handling developer interactions.
-OpenLDAP (Optional): Can be used for user and role management within the Apigee system.

3] Additional Notes:
-Apigee's architecture is designed to be scalable and highly available, supporting the needs of large-scale API deployments.
-The customizable nature of Apigee policies allows for tailoring API behavior to fit specific use cases.

|19. Snenario based Use cases:|
|:--------------------|
```
1. Scenario: You need to enforce a rate limit of 10 requests per minute per user for a specific API endpoint. How would you achieve this?
Answer: Configure a Spike Arrest policy in Apigee with the following settings:
* Target: Select the desired API proxy and target endpoint.
* Spike Arrest Limit: Set to 10 requests per minute.
* Time Window: Set to 1 minute.
* Scope: Choose "User" to limit based on the user identifier extracted from the request.(request.header.X-Forwarded-For)

2. Scenario: You want to transform an incoming JSON payload to a XML before sending it to the backend service. How can you achieve this?
Answer: Utilize a Message Flow or a Policy in Apigee to achieve this transformation. You can leverage dedicated policy like "JSON  to XML" to convert the JSON payload to the desired format. then apply XSLT to convert XML to intended format.

3. Scenario: You need to log sensitive information like passwords or access tokens only to specific environments (e.g., staging) but not in production. How can you manage this?
Answer: Implement Conditional Split and Log policies. The Conditional Split policy can check the environment using the `context.getVariable(environment.name)` function and direct the flow to different branches for logging based on the environment. In the production branch, use a "masking logic" to remove sensitive data before logging.

4. Scenario: You want to cache frequently accessed responses to improve API performance. How do you configure caching in Apigee?
Answer: Add the "Cache" policy in your API proxy. Define the cache expiration time, cache invalidation strategies, and key generation rules based on your requirements.

5. Scenario: You need to restrict access to your API to specific IP addresses or IP ranges. How can you implement this security measure?
Answer: Configure a "Whitelist" or "Blacklist" policy in Apigee. Specify the allowed or blocked IP addresses or ranges using `Access Control Policy`.

6. Scenario: Your API requires users to be authenticated using OAuth 2.0. How can you integrate Apigee with an OAuth provider like Google or Okta?
Answer: Configure the "OAuth 2.0" policy in Apigee. Define the authorization server details, scopes, and token validation settings specific to your chosen OAuth provider. Additionally if we want to use same token of third party authorization set element `<ExternalAuthorization>` to true.

7. Scenario: You want to monitor API usage and track key metrics like request volume, response times, and error rates. How can you achieve this in Apigee?
Answer: Utilize Apigee Edge Analytics. It provides dashboards and reports to visualize and analyze API usage patterns and identify potential issues.

8. If we want Auoth access token to be used only once in its lifetime, how to achieve this?
Answer: 1]serv response for first time and in same call cache the access token. 2]for upcoming calls verify tokens against cache if already cached then use `raise fault` policy to raise error.

9. Scenario: Your API needs to handle large datasets efficiently. How can you implement pagination to avoid sending a massive amount of data in a single response?
Answer: Implement a pagination mechanism in your API design. Use query parameters like "offset" and "limit" to control the number of records returned in each response. leverage cache policy. do this only data  is simple. At gateway level you should not implemenet complex data handling implementation

10. Scenario: You accidentally deployed an API proxy with a critical bug. How can you quickly roll back to a previous version without impacting ongoing traffic?
Answer: Utilize Apigee's revision history and deployment features. You can rollback to a previous stable version of the API proxy from the Management UI or API Management CLI. Apigee gracefully handles traffic switchover to ensure minimal disruption.

11. Scenario: You want to implement a serverless architecture using Apigee and Google Cloud Functions (GCF). How can you integrate Apigee with GCF to offload complex processing tasks?
Answer: Configure a Target element in your API proxy to point to a GCF endpoint. Ensure proper authentication and authorization are in place for the GCF call. The GCF function can then handle the complex processing and return the results back to Apigee for inclusion in the final API response.

12. Scenario: You need to implement A/B testing for your API to compare the performance and user experience of different API versions. How can you achieve this in Apigee?
Answer: Leverage Apigee's Traffic Shift feature. Configure different API proxy revisions to represent your A and B versions. Define traffic distribution percentages for each version and monitor key metrics using Apigee Analytics to identify the version with better performance and user experience.
